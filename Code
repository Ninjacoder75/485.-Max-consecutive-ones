//This code solves the problem of finding the maximum number of consecutive 1s in a binary array (nums). The array consists of only 0s and 1s. The approach is to traverse the array, track the current sum of consecutive 1s, and update the maximum sum whenever a new maximum is found.


class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
       int  n = nums.length;
        int ans = 0;
        
        int currentsum = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(nums[i] == 0){
                currentsum =0;
            }
            else{
           currentsum = currentsum + nums[i];
           if(currentsum>ans){
            ans =currentsum;
           }
        }
